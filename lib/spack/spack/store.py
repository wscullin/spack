"""Components that manage Spack's installation tree.

An install tree, or "build store" consists of two parts:

  1. A package database that tracks what is installed.
  2. A directory layout that determines how the installations
     are laid out.

The store contains all the install prefixes for packages installed by
Spack.  The simplest store could just contain prefixes named by DAG hash,
but we use a fancier directory layout to make browsing the store and
debugging easier.

The directory layout is currently hard-coded to be a YAMLDirectoryLayout,
so called because it stores build metadata within each prefix, in
`spec.yaml` files. In future versions of Spack we may consider allowing
install trees to define their own layouts with some per-tree
configuration.
