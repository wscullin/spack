If you want to report a build error for some package, or a bug in core please use the following template as a guideline:

-----

Summary

### Expected Result

What you expected

### Actual Result

What happened instead

### Steps to reproduce the issue

```console
$ spack <command1> <spec>
$ spack <command2> <spec>
...
```

### Information on your system

This includes:

 1. which platform you are using
 2. any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.)

-----

We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!

If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.

Other than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!
